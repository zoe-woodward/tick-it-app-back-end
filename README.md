# Tickit: A Task Management App
## Tickit is a task management web application built with React on the front-end, Node.js and Express on the back-end, and MongoDB for data storage. This full-stack application allows users to sign up, sign in, and manage their tasks with full CRUD functionality. The app uses JWT tokens for user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only signed-in users can perform actions like creating, updating, or deleting tasks.
